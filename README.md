# SafeSpot App

## Overview

Traditional methods of assessing safety lack real-time data and often rely on subjective judgments, leaving residents and visitors without timely, informed decisions about their safety. Additionally, law enforcement encounters challenges in effectively collaborating with the community.

To address these issues, we've developed a user-friendly community policing app that leverages color-coded mapping on Google Maps to provide dynamic and clear representations of area safety. Our solution emphasizes transparency, real-time data, and collaborative engagement between residents and law enforcement.

## Solution Features

- **Real-Time Data**: Access up-to-date information on public safety issues.
- **Color-Coded Mapping**: Utilize color-coded maps on Google Maps to visualize area safety dynamically.
- **Transparency**: Foster transparency between law enforcement and the community by providing clear safety representations.
- **Collaborative Engagement**: Facilitate collaboration between residents and law enforcement agencies for improved safety outcomes.

## Technology Stack

- **Jetpack Compose**: Developed using Jetpack Compose for modern Android UI development.
- **Google Maps Jetpack Compose Library**: Leveraged for location search, map rendering, and marker functionality.
- **Firebase**: Used for data fetching and authentication, ensuring seamless integration and secure access to public safety-related information.
